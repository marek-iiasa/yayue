1) Files in folder 'Raw'  contain original data for testing/preparing input parameters for 'matouqin' model.

2) File 'data_structure' in folder 'Temp' contains the parameter composition of the whole model.
    Other files in folder 'Temp' contain original and processed parameters for checking the correctness of data processing process.

3) Folders 'Raw' and 'Temp' are in ignore on GitHub.

4) Files 'xxx.dat' are ampl format files, generated by dat_process.py. They contain parameters used in 'matouqin' main model.

5) 'dat1.dat'ï¼šreal data, unit in parameters related to finance is million CNY.

   'test1.dat': test data for 5 hours. Use for checking the model instance.
   'test2.dat': test data for 673 hours.
                Intermittent inflow shows 10 MW every 12 hours and 0 MW every 12 hours.
                Run by 'glpk', Warning: basis matrix is ill-conditioned (cond = 4.76e+13).
   'test3.dat': test data for 1120 hours.
                Intermittent inflow shows 10 MW every 12 hours and 0 MW every 12 hours.
