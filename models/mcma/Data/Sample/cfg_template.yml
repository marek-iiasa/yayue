# Template of the MCMA analysis configuration.
# Please don't modify this file; copy it to your analysis dir and modify the copy
# Configuration info is available in the ../Config.txt

# the following specs are necessary   ------------------------------------------
# therefore, the entries have to be properly filled

# root-name of the core/substantive model
# model_id: jg1

# dir containing the analysis data and results (config, preferences, payoff table)
# the dir must exist because the cfg_usr.yml should be located here
# ana_dir: Data/simple0/

# criteria definition
# each sub-list defines one criterion: [crit_name, type (max or min), core-model var.]
# crit_def: [ [q1, max, x1], [q2, max, x2], [q3, max, x3] ]


# the following specs are optional  --------------------------------------------
# uncomment and modify the value, if desired

# dir with models; each model prepared by dill, using extension dll (eg., jg1.dll)
# modDir: Models/

# sub-directory of ana_dir for results (df's and plots)
# resDir: Results/

# uncomment run_id to define a sub-dir of the resDir for results
# run_id: tst0/

# file-names          -----------
# if the stdout should be redirected, then uncomment next line
# fn_out: stdOut.txt

# Control options     -----------

# max number of iterations
# mxIter: 16

# parRep: True for generating Pareto representation, False for predefined preferences
# parRep: True

# set to either True or False to show/no-show plots
