The configuration of MCMA is now done through YAML file (instead of the
previously specs embedded into the code).
Here is the summary of the step-by-step preparation of the MCMA analysis

1. Prepare the core model in the dill format and store it in the Models dir.
   This dir contains several already prepared models. New models should have
	names composed of unique (within the Models dir) root-name and dll extension,
	e.g., jg2.dll
2. For each MCMA analysis create a subdirectory of the Data dir. This sub-dir
   is referred to as ana_dir
3. Copy the config template file Data/Sample/cfg_templa.yml to ana_dir/cfg_usr.yml
4. Modify the ana_dir/cfg_usr.yml file to specify your analysis. In the template
   all entries are commented. One needs to uncomment and properly define three
	items of the specs:
	- model_id; replace the jg1 by the root name of your core model, e.g., jg2
	- ana_dir;  replace simple0 by the name of your analysis sub-directory
	- crit_def; define the criteria
5. Modify the Data/ana_def.yml file by replacing in
   cfg_usr: ./Data/simple0/
   the word simple0 by the name of your analysis sub-dir
