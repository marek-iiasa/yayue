# Template of the pyMCMA analysis configuration.
# Uncomment and define at least the two required specs.
---

# The following two specs are required.   ------------------------------------------
# Therefore, the (given as example) values of each of the two below specified
# yaml/dict key should be replaced by values correct for each analysis.

# root-name of the core/substantive model instance; the corresponding *dll file
# has to be provided in the Models dir
# model_id: ../xxx/example

# criteria definition
# each sub-list defines one criterion: [crit_name, type (max or min), core-model var.]
# crit_def: [ [cr_name, min | max, var_name], [xx, min, xx], [] ]


# The following specs are optional.  --------------------------------------------
# If the option is desired, then uncomment the line with {key: value} pair and
# modify the value

# Directories. Each dir-name needs for finish with the / char          -----------
# Sub-directory of the corresponding ana_dir containing results (df's and plots)
# resDir: Results/

# A sub-directory of the resDir for results of the corresponding execution run.
# Note: many subdirectories can be defined to organize outcomes of diverse runs.
# run_id: tst1/

# file-names          -----------
# To redirect the stdout (e.g., of a long run) define the corresponding file name
# (the option identified by the key: fn_out) 
# fn_out: out1.txt

# core-model variables values of which shall be included in the report
# rep_vars: ['x1', 'x2', 'actS']

# Control options     -----------
# max number of iterations
# mxIter: 1000
